{"problem_text": "Largely because of riding in cars, you are used to horizontal circular motion. Vertical circular motion would be a novelty. In this sample problem, such motion seems to defy the gravitational force.\r\n\r\nIn a 1901 circus performance, Allo \"Dare Devil\" Diavolo introduced the stunt of riding a bicycle in a loopthe-loop (Figure). Assuming that the loop is a circle with radius $R=2.7 \\mathrm{~m}$, what is the least speed $v$ that Diavolo and his bicycle could have at the top of the loop to remain in contact with it there?", "answer_latex": " 5.1", "answer_number": " 5.1", "unit": " m/s", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 6.04", "comment": " "}
