{"problem_text": "In 1896 in Waco, Texas, William Crush parked two locomotives at opposite ends of a 6.4-km-long track, fired them up, tied their throttles open, and then allowed them to crash head-on at full speed (Figure) in front of 30,000 spectators. Hundreds of people were hurt by flying debris; several were killed. Assuming each locomotive weighed $1.2 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~N}$ and its acceleration was a constant $0.26 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2$, what was the total kinetic energy of the two locomotives just before the collision?", "answer_latex": " 2.0", "answer_number": "2.0", "unit": " $10^8$ J", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 7.01", "comment": " "}
