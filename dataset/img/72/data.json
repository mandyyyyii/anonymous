{"problem_text": "Many students consider problems involving ramps (inclined planes) to be especially hard. The difficulty is probably visual because we work with (a) a tilted coordinate system and (b) the components of the gravitational force, not the full force. Here is a typical example with all the tilting and angles explained. (In WileyPLUS, the figure is available as an animation with voiceover.) In spite of the tilt, the key idea is to apply Newton's second law to the axis along which the motion occurs.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cord pulls a box of sea biscuits up along a frictionless plane inclined at angle $\\theta=30.0^{\\circ}$. The box has mass $m=5.00 \\mathrm{~kg}$, and the force from the cord has magnitude $T=25.0 \\mathrm{~N}$. What is the box's acceleration $a$ along the inclined plane?", "answer_latex": " 0.100", "answer_number": " 0.100", "unit": "$m/s^2$", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 5.04", "comment": " "}
