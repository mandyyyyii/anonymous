{"problem_text": "Assume that all gases are perfect and that data refer to 298 K unless otherwise stated. In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considered a global average temperature rise of $1.0-3.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ likely by the year 2100 , with $2.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ its best estimate. Because water vapour is itself a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapour content of the atmosphere is of some concern to climate change experts. Predict the relative increase in water vapour in the atmosphere based on a temperature rises of $2.0 \\mathrm{~K}$, assuming that the relative humidity remains constant. (The present global mean temperature is $290 \\mathrm{~K}$, and the equilibrium vapour pressure of water at that temperature is 0.0189 bar.)", "answer_latex": " 13", "answer_number": "13", "unit": "$\\%$", "source": "atkins", "problemid": " p3.39", "comment": " "}
