{"problem_text": "Assume that all gases are perfect and that data refer to 298 K unless otherwise stated. Find an expression for the change in entropy when two blocks of the same substance and of equal mass, one at the temperature $T_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and the other at $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$, are brought into thermal contact and allowed to reach equilibrium.
